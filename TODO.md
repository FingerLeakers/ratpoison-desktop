Plans for Further Impovements
=============================

* Switch base directory from `.ratpoison` to
  e.g. `.config/abe/desktop`. Also move `.zsh` to e.g. `.config/zsh`

* Create [mr](http://myrepos.branchable.com/) repo for initial cloning
  of all the git repos I usually have on more than one machine, based
  on or at least modeled after
  [RichiH's mr config repo](https://github.com/RichiH/vcsh_mr_template).

  Or just migrate all my dot file repos to using
  [RichiH's vcsh](https://github.com/RichiH/vcsh).

* Split off non- or at least not-only commandline stuff (`emacs.el`,
  `gitconfig`, `gitignore`, `lintianrc`, `colordiffrc`, `screenrc`,
  some of the script in `bin/`, ...)  into its own repository

* Make rc.lua work with Awesome 3.4 and 3.5 at the same time.
