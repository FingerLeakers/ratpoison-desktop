Plans for Further Impovements
=============================

* Switch base directory from `.ratpoison` to
  e.g. `.config/abe/desktop`. Also move `.zsh` to e.g. `.config/zsh`

* Create mr repo for initial cloning of all the git repos I usually
  have on more than one machine, based on or at least modeled after
  [RichiH's mr config repo](https://github.com/RichiH/vcsh_mr_template).

* Split off non- or at least not-only commandline stuff (`emacs.el`,
  `gitconfig`, `gitignore`, `lintianrc`, `colordiffrc`, `screenrc`,
  some of the script in `bin/`, ...)  into its own repository
