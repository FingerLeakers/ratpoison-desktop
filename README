======================
Axel's ratpoison setup
======================

These files are needed to get the setup running as I have it on my
ASUS EeePC 701 running Debian Sid.

Since they're usually not expected to reside in .ratpoison, some
symlinks are necessary:

~/.keynavrc 				   → keynavrc
~/.xsession 				   → xsession
~/bin/xrandr-vga-off.sh			   → bin/xrandr-vga-off.sh

Sources available via http://github.com/xtaran/ratpoison-desktop and
http://git.noone.org/?p=ratpoison.git

Needs at least the following Debian packages (besides essential
packages) to be installed:

* x11-xserver-utils (for xmodmap, xrdb and xsetroot)
* ratpoison
* i3status >= 2.2
* xmobar
* dwm-tools or suckless-tools (for dmenu)
* ratmenu >= 2.3.20
* conkeror or some other web browser
* xclip
* autocutsel
* unclutter
* xscreensaver or xtrlock
* hsetroot
* yeahconsole
* xterm and/or urxvt
* keynav
* xrandr
* xcompmgr
* xrootconsole
* inotail
* transset-df
* gnome-keyring (for gnome-settings-daemon)
* busybox-syslogd (for logread)
* emacs (for emacs and emacsclient)
* wget (needed by iplet)

Recommended, used in optional or commented stuff:

* openssh-client (for ssh-add and ssh-agent)
* Alternative window and session managers:
  * lxsession
  * stumpwm
  * flwm
  * fvwm
* root-tail
* colortail
* xserver-xorg-input-synaptics (for syndaemon)
