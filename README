======================
Axel's ratpoison setup
======================

These files are needed to get the setup running as I have it on my
ASUS EeePC 701 running Debian Sid.

Since they're usually not expected to reside in .ratpoison, some
symlinks are necessary:

~/.ratpoisonrc 				   → ratpoisonrc
~/.xsession 				   → xsession
~/bin/xrandr-vga-off.sh			   → bin/xrandr-vga-off.sh
