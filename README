======================
Axel's ratpoison setup
======================

On my ASUS EeePC 701 I run Debian GNU/Linux Sid with a more less
unusual “desktop”: I use the ratpoison window manager (windows are
made fullscreen by default and keybindings are nearly identical to GNU
Screen) and the xmobar text status bar, filled with data by i3status.

These files are needed to get the setup running.

Since most of the configuration files included are not expected to
reside in .ratpoison, some symlinks are necessary:

~/.gitconfig 				   → gitconfig
~/.xsession 				   → xsession
~/bin/xrandr-vga-off.sh			   → bin/xrandr-vga-off.sh

Sources available via http://git.noone.org/?p=ratpoison.git,
http://gitorious.org/abe-ratpoison-desktop, and
http://github.com/xtaran/ratpoison-desktop.

Needs at least the following Debian packages (besides essential
packages) to be installed:

* x11-xserver-utils (for xmodmap, xrdb, xrandr and xsetroot)
* ratpoison
* i3status >= 2.2
* xmobar
* dwm-tools or suckless-tools (for dmenu)
* ratmenu >= 2.3.20
* conkeror or some other web browser
* xclip
* autocutsel
* unclutter
* xscreensaver or xtrlock
* hsetroot
* yeahconsole
* xterm and/or urxvt
* keynav >= 0.20101014.3067
* xcompmgr
* xrootconsole
* inotail
* transset-df
* gnome-keyring (for gnome-settings-daemon)
* busybox-syslogd (for logread)
* emacs (for emacs and emacsclient)
* wget (needed by iplet)
* scrot
* nawm (no more in Debian)

Recommended, used in optional or commented stuff:

* openssh-client (for ssh-add and ssh-agent)
* Alternative window and session managers:
  * lxsession
  * stumpwm
  * flwm
  * fvwm
* loco, ccze, lwatch, or colortail
