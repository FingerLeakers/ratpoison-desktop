======================
Axel's ratpoison setup
======================

These files are needed to get the setup running as I have it on my
ASUS EeePC 701 running Debian Sid.

Sice they're usually not expected to reside in .ratpoison, some
symlinks are necessary:

~/bin/dmenu-abe.pl			   → dmenu-abe.pl
~/bin/dmenu-for-ratpoison.sh 		   → dmenu-for-ratpoison.sh
~/bin/ratpoison-interactive-window-list.pl → ratpoison-interactive-window-list.pl
~/.dmenu-abe.rc 			   → dmenu-abe.rc
~/.ratpoisonrc 				   → ratpoisonrc
~/.xsession 				   → xsession
