======================
Axel's ratpoison setup
======================

These files are needed to get the setup running as I have it on my
ASUS EeePC 701 running Debian Sid.

Since they're usually not expected to reside in .ratpoison, some
symlinks are necessary:

~/.ratpoisonrc 				   → ratpoisonrc
~/.xsession 				   → xsession
~/bin/xrandr-vga-off.sh			   → bin/xrandr-vga-off.sh

Needs at least the following Debian packages to be installed:

* ratpoison
* i3status >= 2.2
* xmobar
* dwm-tools or suckless-tools
* ratmenu
* conkeror or some other web browser
* xclip
* autocutsel
* unclutter
* openssh-client
* xscreensaver or xtrlock
* hsetroot
* yeahconsole
* xterm and/or urxvt
* keynav
* xrandr
* xcompmgr
